audio
=====

aeon performs a series of customizable transformations on the audio before provisioning the data to the model.

    :alt: "Additive noise"

1. Probabilistically add noise to raw audio waveform (with the probability controlled by the ``add_noise_probability`` parameter). Noise is chosen from a random file in ``noise_index_file`` and added at a random offset and scaling (controlled by the ``noise_level`` parameter).  Noise addition happens only in the time domain (as opposed to the spectral domain).

2. If ``time_scale_fraction`` has been set to a pair of values ``(tmin, tmax)``, then the spectral frames will be randomly squeezed or stretched in the time domain according to a random value chosen uniformly from the interval between ``tmin`` and ``tmax``.  For example

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Parameter", "Default", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 40
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

    noise_index_file (string)| | File of pathnames to noisy audio files, one per line.
    noise_level (tuple(float, float))| (0.0, 0.5) | How much noise to add (a value of 1 would be 0 dB SNR). Each clip applies its own value chosen randomly from with the given bounds.
    add_noise_probability (float)| 0.0 | Probability of adding noise
    time_scale_fraction (tuple(float, float))| (1.0, 1.0) | Scale factor for simple linear time-warping. Each clip applies its own value chosen randomly from with the given bounds.
