Faster-RCNN Localization
============

The object localization provider module (``type=localization_rcnn``) is designed to work with the Faster-RCNN model. The manifest should include paths to both the image but also the bounding box annotations:

.. code-block:: bash
    @FILE	FILE
    /image_dir/image0001.jpg	/annotations/0001.json
    /image_dir/image0002.jpg	/annotations/0002.json
    /image_dir/image0003.jpg	/annotations/0003.json

Each annotation is in the JSON format, which should have the main field "object" containing the bounding box, class, and difficulty of each object in the image. For example:


.. code-block:: bash

   {
       "object": [
           {
               "bndbox": {
                   "xmax": 262,
                   "xmin": 207,
                   "ymax": 75,
                   "ymin": 10
               },
               "difficult": false,
               "name": "tvmonitor",
           },
           {
               "bndbox": {
                   "xmax": 431,
                   "xmin": 369,
                   "ymax": 335,
                   "ymin": 127
               },
               "difficult": false,
               "name": "person",
           },
       ],
   }

To generate these json files from the XML format used by some object localization datasets such as PASCALVOC, see the main neon repository.

The dataloader generates on-the-fly the anchor targets required for training neon's Faster-RCNN model. Several important parameters control this anchor generation process:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Default", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 10, 50
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

   height (uint) | *Required* | Height of provisioned image (pixels)
   width (uint) | *Required* | Width of provisioned image (pixels)
   name (string) | ~"~" | Name prepended to the output buffer name
   class_names (vector of strings) | *Required* | List of class names (e.g. [~"person~", ~"tvmonitor~"]). Should match the names provided in the json annotation files.
   rois_per_image (long) | 256 | Number of anchors per image used for training.
   scaling_factor (float) | 0.0625 | Feature map scaling of the convolutional network portion. Default scaling is shown for VGG-16 network.
   base_size (long) | 16 | Base length of anchor boxes
   ratios (vector) | [0.5, 1, 2] | List of aspect ratios used to generate anchor boxes.
   scales (vector) | [8, 16, 32] | List of area sizes used to generate anchor boxes.
   negative_overlap (float) | 0.3 | Negative anchors have less than this value with any ground truth box.
   positive_overlap (float) | 0.7 | Positive anchors have greater than this value with at least one ground truth box.
   foreground_fraction (float) | 0.5 | Maximal fraction of total anchors that are positive.
   output_type (string) | ~"float~" | Output data type.
   max_gt_boxes (long) | 64 | Maximum number of ground truth boxes in dataset. Used to buffer the ground truth boxes.

This provider creates a set of eleven buffers that are consumed by the Faster-RCNN model. Defining ``A`` as the number of anchor boxes that tile the final convolutional feature map, ``M`` as the ``max_gt_boxes`` parameter, and ``N`` as the batch_size, we have the provisioned buffers in this order:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Buffer Name", "Shape", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 10, 45
   :delim: |

   bb_targets | (N, 4 * A) | Bounding box regressions for the region proposal network
   bb_targets_mask | (N, 4 * A) | Bounding box target masks. Only positive labels have non-zero elements.
   labels | (N, 2 * A) | Target positive/negative labels for the region proposal network.
   labels_mask | (N, 2 * A) | Mask for the labels buffer. Includes ``rois_per_image`` non-zero elements.
   im_shape | (N, 2) | Shape of the input image.
   gt_boxes | (N, M * 4) | Ground truth bounding box coordinates, already scaled by ``im_scale``. Boxes are padded into a larger buffer.
   num_gt_boxes | (N) | Number of ground truth bounding boxes.
   gt_classes | (N, M) | Class label for each ground truth box.
   im_scale | (N) | Scaling factor that was applied to the image.
   is_difficult | (N, M) | Indicates if each ground truth box has the difficult property.

For Faster-RCNN, we handle variable image sizes by padding an image into a fixed canvas to pass to the network. The image configuration is used as above with the added flags ``crop_enable`` set to False and ```fixed_aspect_ratio``` set to True. These settings place the largest possible image in the output canvas in the upper left corner. Note that the ``angle`` transformation is not supported.
